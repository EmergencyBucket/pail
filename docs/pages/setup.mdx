# Setup

Pail is a full stack NextJS application meaning only one web service needs to be run along with a PostgreSQL database.
The easiest way to deploy is via Railway which will manage nearly all settings for you.

# Manual Setup

1. Clone the project off of GitHub.
2. Install all dependencies by running
```bash
npm install -g yarn
yarn install
```
3. Install + setup PostgreSQL and set an environment variable ``DATABASE_URL_NON_POOLING`` to the full connection URL.
4. Also set a ``NEXTAUTH_SECRET`` in your ``.env`` file (this should be completely random).
5. Setup GitHub sign in via the tutorial [here](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/github) (Set the ``GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`` and ``GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`` in your environment variables).
6. Optionally set the ``DOCKER_USERNAME`` and ``DOCKER_PASSWORD`` to pull images from the GitHub container registry.
7. Push the db schema and build the website by running ``yarn build``.
